Roopam
============

Installation:
1. Drag "Roopam" to the Applications folder
2. Open it from Applications - it's signed and notarized by Apple, so
   it will launch normally with no security warnings.

After First Run:
- Add your favorite folders and choose icons - that's it. The app adds the
  folder to Finder's sidebar and applies the icon for you.

Do I Need to Keep the Manager Running?
--------------------------------------
NO! Sidebar icons persist because they're stored in Finder's own Favorites
list plus a small registered helper bundle - nothing else needs to run.

  • Persist across reboots - no background process to restart
  • Survive Finder restarts - icons reappear automatically

The Manager app is only needed when you want to add, edit, or delete favorites.

Uninstall:
1. Delete favorites in the app (this removes the sidebar rows it added and
   restores the original icon on rows you added yourself)
2. Drag "Roopam" to Trash
3. Delete ~/Library/Application Support/Roopam (optional)

Roopam
============

Installation:
1. Drag "Roopam" to the Applications folder

First Run (Security Approval):
Since this app is not notarized by Apple, macOS will block it on first run.
To open it:

  1. Try to open the app (it will be blocked)
  2. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security
  3. Scroll down and click "Open Anyway"

After First Run:
- Add your favorite folders and choose icons - that's it. The app adds the
  folder to Finder's sidebar and applies the icon for you.
