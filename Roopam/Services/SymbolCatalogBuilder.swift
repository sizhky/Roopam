/// Compiles every custom SF Symbol used by an enabled favorite into a single
/// `Assets.car` inside the icon helper bundle.
///
/// 0.6.0 compiled one symbolset per generated app; 0.7.0 has exactly one helper
/// bundle, so the symbols are deduplicated by name (two favorites pointing at the
/// same SVG share one symbolset) and compiled in a single `xcrun actool` run.
///
/// ## Nothing is handed to `actool` as the user wrote it
///
/// Up to 1.0 this copied the stored SVG straight into the `.symbolset`, which only
/// works when the file already *is* a hand-made SF Symbols template - so an
/// ordinary logo failed with "must have a glyph for Regular weight Medium size"
/// and took every other custom icon in the same `actool` run down with it.
///
/// Now every icon, without exception, is parsed by `SymbolValidator.glyphGeometry`
/// and re-wrapped by `SymbolTemplateSynthesizer`:
///
/// * An **arbitrary SVG** becomes one flattened outline inside a synthesized
///   `Template v.7.0` scaffold.
/// * An **SVG that is already a template** - every custom icon stored by 0.5.0 and
///   0.6.0 - has its `Regular-S` glyph lifted out and re-wrapped the same way.
///   Passing such a file through untouched would also compile (measured: a
///   `Template v.6.0` file compiles on its own), but it is deliberately not done:
///   the app can only *preview* what it can parse, so a file it ships unparsed is
///   a file whose sidebar icon it cannot show. Re-synthesizing means one code path,
///   one scaffold whose every requirement was established by ablation, and a
///   preview that is the compiled glyph rather than a guess at it. The only thing
///   lost is per-weight artwork variation, and a sidebar icon is drawn at one
///   weight.
